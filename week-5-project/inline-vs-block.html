<h1>Understanding Inline vs. Block elements</h1>

<p>This is a block element which is highlighted red with a border to show how much space it takes. Notice that the block element consumes an entire row</p>

<p>This is another block element, but with an <span>inline element</span> that has a highlighted green border, but only takes up the space of the content rather than the entire row</p>
